# Master's Thesis: Quantum Simulation of Physical Problems Using the Ising-QUBO Framework

This repository contains the code and documentation associated with the Master's Thesis titled "Quantum Simulation of Physical Problems Using the Ising-QUBO Framework".

## Project Description

The aim of this work is to explore and develop quantum simulation techniques to solve physical problems using the Ising-QUBO framework. The Ising-QUBO framework will be implemented in Python and applied to a series of specific physical problems to study its behavior and effectiveness compared to classical methods.

## Repository Structure

- `docs` Contains documentation related to the project, such as the final thesis report and other relevant documents.
- `src` Here lies the source code of the project, including the implementation of the Ising-QUBO framework and specific simulations.
- `data`: Contains the input data required for simulations.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
- `tests`: Unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality.
- `results`: Simulation results.
- `requirements`.txt: File listing Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `LICENSE`: License under which the project is distributed.
